### ðŸ’¡ Flexbox Layout Instructions 

To style this webpage using Flexbox, begin by setting the `body` to use the Arial font, apply a light gray background color (`#f0f0f0`), and add 20 pixels of padding to give the content breathing space.

Next, create a container and apply `display: flex` to enable Flexbox. Set the `flex-direction` to `row` so that the child elements (boxes) are laid out horizontally. Use `justify-content: space-between` to distribute the boxes with space between them. Enable wrapping using `flex-wrap: wrap` to ensure that items can move to the next line if there's not enough space. Add a `gap` of 20 pixels between the flex items to create visual spacing. Give the container a white background, some internal padding of 20 pixels, and rounded corners using `border-radius: 10px`.

For each individual box (child of the container), apply a green background color (`#4CAF50`), white text, 20 pixels of padding, centered text alignment, and slightly rounded corners with `border-radius: 8px`. To control the size behavior, set `flex-grow: 1` so that all boxes expand equally to fill available space, `flex-shrink: 1` to allow them to shrink if needed, and `flex-basis: 200px` as their starting width before growing or shrinking.

To differentiate specific boxes, give the second box a blue background (`#2196F3`) and set `flex-grow: 2`, making it grow twice as much as the others. For the third box, assign a red background (`#f44336`) and `flex-shrink: 2` so it shrinks more quickly when the container space is reduced.

These settings collectively demonstrate key Flexbox properties including layout direction, spacing, wrapping, and dynamic resizing behavior based on grow, shrink, and basis values.
