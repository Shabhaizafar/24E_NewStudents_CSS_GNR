  <title>Team of 11 Players - Style Instructions Only</title>
  <style>
    /*
    To style the team of 11 players using only the allowed CSS properties—width, height, margin, padding, border, and border-radius—begin by setting the body of the page with no margin, a padding of 20px, a sans-serif font, and a light gray background (#f0f0f0). The main container (.team-container) should have a width of 95%, centered using margin: 0 auto, include 10px of padding, and use text-align: center to center the inline-block player cards. Each .player-card should be displayed as an inline-block with a height of 180px, a white background, a minimum width of 180px, 15px padding, and 10px margin on all sides.

Each player card should be styled uniquely. For Player 1, use width: fit-content, a solid green border (2px solid #2ecc71), and border-radius: 10px. Player 2 should have a width of 220px, a blue dashed border (3px dashed #3498db), and border-radius: 25px. Player 3 should be 250px wide with a top dotted orange border, right solid dark blue, bottom dashed red, left double purple, and rounded top-left and bottom-left corners (border-radius: 30px 0 0 30px). Player 4 should be a 180px-wide circle (border-radius: 50%) with a solid purple border and 30px of padding. Player 5 should be 200px wide, with a yellow-orange double border, asymmetric corner radius (5px top-left, 20px top-right), and 10px vertical, 25px horizontal padding.

Player 6 should be 240px wide with a dotted teal border, an irregular border-radius (10% 40%), and custom padding: 20px top, 10px right/bottom, 30px left. Player 7 should be 270px wide, have a red groove border, asymmetric border-radius (10px 0 10px 0), and margin of 15px top/bottom and 20px left/right. Player 8 should be 230px wide, with a grey outset border, a mixed-radius (15px, 50%, 5px, 30px), and 10px vertical, 15px horizontal padding. Player 9 should be 260px wide with a solid cyan border, top corners rounded (25px 25px 0 0), and asymmetric margin (5px top, 15px right, 25px bottom, 10px left). Player 10 should use width: fit-content with max-width: 300px, a dark blue dashed border, fully rounded corners (border-radius: 100px), and 20px padding on all sides. Lastly, Player 11 should be 210px wide, use a double orange border, asymmetric radius (0 20px 20px 0), and 10px top, 20px right, 20px bottom, and 10px left padding.

Additionally, inside each player card, the player's name should be styled with bold text, font size 16px, and a bottom margin of 10px. The role should use 14px font size with a 5px bottom margin.
